Project1: EDA for NYC turnstile data


# Overview

This project is all about EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis). We are given a prompt from a fictional company in NYC called Woment Tech Women Yes to find the best
location for them to place their marketing team for a gala they are hosting in June. We are given data from NYC's MTA turnstiles in a csv format. We have to use
this data to draw conclusions and present themt to the team. 

# Dataset/Features

NYC MTA turnstile data is open on their website for anyone to use. It contains data for years of entries and exits at each station. The features that are included are:   

C/A Unit: Control Area  
UNIT: Remote unit for station  
SCP: Subunit Channel Position represents a specific address for a decive  
STATION: Represents the stations name and the device located at  
LINENAME: Represents all train lines tha can be boarded at this station  
DIVISION: Represents the Line originally the station belonged to BMT, IRT, IND  
DATE: Represents the time for a scheduled audit event  
DESc: Represents the "REGULAR" scheduled audit event  
ENTRIES: The cumulative entry register value for a device  
EXITS: The cumulative exit register value for a device  

# Findings

We decided that the best time to check for traffic is a few month before the event to allow for people to respond to the event. We found that during the weekends ridership drops drastically and during weekdays theres alot more traffic. We also found that 42nd St Station had the most foot traffic in the tech areas of NYC.
